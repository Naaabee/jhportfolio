# Portfolio 📝
## Description:
Build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you've built previously. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.
